# MembraneKeyboard

This is a small code to test a membrane keyboard that I designed, you can watch the video here:

The keyboard has 5 rows and 5 columns, the code is developed to read the matrix and to return a Character for each key pressed.
The Characters are defined in a list, the position of the Character is determined by the row*column
